Report: Large Coursework
Clemente Jose Scaravilli

Music is a big part of my life. This project gave me the chance to create a magazine featuring my songs in its content. I used a hierarchical structure as I think the way to navigate through a website with that structure is mostly natural.

Being such a music enthusiast I used a lot of music websites and magazines as an inspiration for my own design. I took inspiration from NME's web magazine, Coldplay's webpage, Rolling Stones magazine, Billboard hot 100, Spotify charts, etc.

Accessibility was a hard topic to get right, first I used the Alt descriptions for my images, I used my headings and content in a way that it is simple to follow and easy to see. I used colors that have a big contrast with each other. You can access all content using only the tab key,

I made important clickable links/buttons stand out from other normal text or headers by changing color. I made the website consistent in its design so every looks similar making it easier to follow and understand. When scrolling down the navigation bar disappears, that way you can get a better view of the page and when you scroll up it pops back again giving you access to it whenever you need it.

I had to learn how to make a navigation bar for when your website goes under a certain amount of pixels wide (AKA. responsive, mobile). I watched YouTube videos about it and read a few forums on it. How the css file interacts with javascript so when you click on the hamburger menu JS makes changes to the css file so that the navigation bar slides from the right and shows.
The videos I watched showed the bar coming from the top, which I didn't like, so I changed it to come from the right side, it felt more intuitive.
When hiding the menu, instead of using a top: -100%;, i used a right: -100%; and then bringing it back with a right: 0;

Another thing I liked and had to look up for tutorials was how to create the effect for the last page (events) where you can hover over the specifics events(shows) and the picture inside will scale bigger but not go over its limits on the div. The problem I had with it is that the image was growing from the top left instead of the center and going over the limits of the div , so I had to look for a solution, which was using the parameter scale(); instead of width: and giving the div containing the image a parameter of "overflow: hidden;".

A thing that kept me stuck for a while had to do with images and how to manipulate them. after a while i found out that the best way to insert an image is to put the image inside a div, give height and width attributes to that div and then to the image give it a width of 100%. This way allows you to have better control over the image overall.

I believe the style of the page and the content worked well because I made use of a pallet of colors. Basically I went to www.coolors.co and generated a pallet of colours compatible with each other, this allowed me to make a pleasant looking website that doesn't overload your view with information.
Another aspect that I think works well is the responsiveness of it. Although the structure of the website allows it to be easy to make it responsive, I spent a lot of time getting around and finding a way to make the website fast and responsive.
The way I divided the content of the pages into different files. The Navbar and the footer is almost the same in all html files but i use only one css for them, style_constant.css. This allowed me to keep the same design while working on different pages more efficiently without tampering with the navbar or footer.

I think I could improve how modular some elements are. For example, if I want to change a specific album or show, i have to do it hardcode way. I think i could implement a database that i could link to the project, this way I would tamper with the code itself but with a database instead.

I used fonts from Adobe, and icons from https://fontawesome.com/icons, I used YouTube videos to get info, I will attach some:
